For the work of planning disaster recovery strategies, it's important to know the global AWS infrastructure. It is necessary to use at least 2 regions to avoid impacts of disrupting services at the region level. View the AWS infrastructure map and choose the regions that will be used by your applications.
Go to [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

{{% notice tip%}} <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>
The regions are geographically distributed and this reflects the time of communication between them. If your application is latency-sensitive, you should balance the proximity of regions with the possibility of a regional event.

Some services are not available in all regions. When choosing a region, confirm that the service you want to use is available. See the table for [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).
