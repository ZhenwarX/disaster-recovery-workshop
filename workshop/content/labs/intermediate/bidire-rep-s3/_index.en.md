### Objective

This exercise will show you the steps for using object replication through Amazon S3 bucket AWS Regions (*Cross region replication*). If you want more information [click here]({{< ref "/services/storage/s3/s3-crr" >}} "Amazon S3").

**By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:**

- Perform Auto-Replication of Objects in Amazon S3 Buckets
- Automate Disaster Recovery (DR) for Applications Using Objects in Amazon S3
- Search for logs on CloudTrail to improve understanding how cross-region replication works.

**Estimated Duration:** 20 minutes

**Approximate Cost**: 1 USD

### Introduction

This lab will guide you to increase the resilience of applications that rely on objects in Amazon S3. The functionality of [Amazon S3 replication (CRR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pt_br/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html), allows asynchronous copying to another AWS Region.
