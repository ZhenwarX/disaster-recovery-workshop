Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Elasticsearch clusters on the AWS cloud. Elasticsearch is a well-known search and analysis engine for use cases, such as log analysis, real-time application monitoring, and click stream analysis. With Amazon ES, you get direct access to the Elasticsearch APIs; existing code and applications work seamlessly with the service.
