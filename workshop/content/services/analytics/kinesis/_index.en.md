You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large [streams](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/streaming-data/) of real-time data records. You can create data processing applications, known as Kinesis Data Streams applications. A typical Kinesis Data Streams application reads data from a data stream as data records. These applications can use the Kinesis Client Library and run on Amazon EC2 instances. You can send processed records to dashboards, use them to generate alerts, dynamically change pricing and advertising strategies, or send data to a variety of other AWS services
