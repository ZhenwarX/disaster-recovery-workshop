When you create a record, you can choose a routing policy, which determines how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries:

**Simple routing policy** — Use for a single resource that performs a certain role for your domain, for example, a web server that provides content to the example.com site.

**Failover routing policy** — Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.

**Geolocation routing policy** — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of users.

**Geo-proximity routing policy** — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and optionally switch resource traffic at one location to resources elsewhere.

**Latency Routing Policy** — Use when you have resources across multiple AWS regions and want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.

**Multi-Value Response Routing Policy** — Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight randomly selected healthy records.

**Weighted routing policy** — Use to route traffic to multiple resources in the proportions you specify.
