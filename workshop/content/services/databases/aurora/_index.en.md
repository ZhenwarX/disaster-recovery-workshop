Amazon Aurora is a relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL built for the cloud that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and economics of open source databases.

Amazon Aurora is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases. The service offers the security, availability, and reliability of commercial databases for one tenth of the cost. Amazon Aurora is managed by Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), which automates time-consuming administrative tasks such as hardware provisioning, database configuration, patching, and backups.

Amazon Aurora offers a distributed, fault tolerant, auto-recovery storage system that automatically scales up to 128 TB per DB instance. Amazon Aurora delivers high levels of performance and availability, with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).
