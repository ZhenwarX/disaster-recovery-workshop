You can create an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster as a Read Replica in a different AWS Region than the source DB cluster. Following this approach can improve your disaster recoverability, allow you to scale read operations in an AWS Region closer to your users, and make it easier to move from one AWS Region to another.
