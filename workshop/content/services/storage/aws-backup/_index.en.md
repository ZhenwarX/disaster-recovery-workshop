AWS Backup is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data backup across all AWS services in the cloud and on-premises. With AWS Backup, you can configure backup policies and monitor the backup activities of your AWS resources in one place. AWS Backup automates and consolidates backup jobs that were previously performed service by service and removes the need to create custom scripts and manual processes. With just a few clicks in the AWS Backup console, you can create backup policies that automate the management of scheduling and retention of backups.
