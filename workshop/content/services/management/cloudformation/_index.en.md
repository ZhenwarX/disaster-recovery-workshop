AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and configure your Amazon Web Services resources to spend less time managing these resources and more time focusing on your applications running AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources you want (such as Amazon EC2 roles and Amazon RDS tables) and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring these resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and find out what depends on what; AWS CloudFormation handles all of this.
